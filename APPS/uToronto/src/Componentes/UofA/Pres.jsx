        The Catholic University of Angola (Universidade Católica de Angola,
        UCAN) is a Catholic institution in Angola’s capital of Luanda. On 7
        August 1992, the government of Angola allowed the Angolan Catholic
        Church to establish its own university. Through approval by the
        Episcopal Conference it started teaching on 22 February 1999. It is a
        private institution and one of 12 recognized private universities. Msgr.
        Manuel Imbamba is the « magno chanceler » and Father Vicente Cauchi is
        the rector. In 2012 it had about 6,000 enrolled students. The language
        of classes is Portuguese, although English as a second language (ESL) is
        offered. Four departments have been founded: Social sciences, Economics,
        Law and Engineering. Source: Wikipedia
